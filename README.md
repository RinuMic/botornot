# BotOrNot

## Overview
**BotOrNot** is an ML application designed to classify network traffic and determine if it is generated by a bot or a human. This project includes a Flask-based web server that provides an API for making predictions.

## Features
- **Model Prediction**: Predicts if the given network traffic is from a bot or a human.
- **Caching**: Uses Flask-Caching for improved performance by caching the results of predictions.
- **Swagger API Documentation**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API.
- **Logging**: Logs the time taken to process each request for performance monitoring.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/botornot.git
cd botornot
```
## Setup Instructions

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

### install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Test Model
### Model and Data Files
Ensure that the best_model.pkl file is in the models directory.

### Run Flask Application
``` bash
cd src
python deploy.py
```
The application will start and be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

### Performance Optimization
Caching has been implemented using Flask-Caching to improve response times and reduce server load by storing the results of predictions for repeated requests.

### Technical Performance
The application logs the time taken to process each request, providing insight into the performance of the model and the API.

### API Documentation
Swagger UI is available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/apidocs for interactive API documentation and testing.
